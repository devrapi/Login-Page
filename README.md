**Description:**

This project implements a basic login and registration system using a combination of essential web development technologies:

HTML: Provides the structure and content of the web pages, including forms for user input.
CSS: Styles the appearance of the forms and web pages for a visually appealing interface.
JavaScript: Enhances user experience with functionalities like input validation and potentially creating interactive elements.
PHP: Handles server-side processing, including user authentication (login), registration, and potentially interacting with a database for user data storage.

**Features:**

Login Form: Allows registered users to enter their credentials and access the protected areas of your website.
Registration Form: Enables new users to create accounts with usernames and passwords.
Error Handling (Optional): PHP can provide feedback to users in case of invalid login attempts, registration errors, or other issues.
